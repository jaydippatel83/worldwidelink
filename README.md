## What it does
- Multipurpose Escrow: Multipurpose Cross-Chain escrow agreement ensures ethical behavior in decentralized transactions between two parties. In WWL, both parties stake tokens, offering dispute resolution through a DAO arbitrator.

- Lending and Borrowing: CCIP-powered Cross-Chain Lending and Borrowing: Seamlessly support Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche through the WWL, eliminating the need for bridging or native gas tokens.

- SOS Alerts based automatic fund transfer: Millions locked on the chain may be inaccessible in emergencies. With WWL SOS Alerts, set triggers: if inactive, Trigger 1 sends an email via Chainlink Keeper; if still inactive, Trigger 2 alerts loved ones and transfers funds.

- Liquid Staking: Cross-chain liquid staking aggregator that enables users to provide liquidity across different protocols on various blockchains, all on one platform.

- On/Off-Ramp Integration: WWL offers integration with the Transak SDK to simplify the process for users to on and off-ramp crypto to WWL.

- Token Transfer: Users can seamlessly transfer tokens across different blockchains within the Dapp, eliminating the need for bridging, managing native tokens for gas fees, or handling multiple wallets.
